# Getting Started with Create React App

# This is my live project Link [Classic Frames](https://classic-frames.web.app/).

> This project is about an individual provider who serve some services of his work. I choose the photographer niche from my trainer's suggestion. Then I gathered some knowledge about an individual providers website design and learnt some basic things that should be included in this kind of websites. Than I started design and functionality. I wish, I could do this website properly. But I don't know why I wouldn't able to complete is properly as i want. Though i made it full responsive. That the one things I think i did fo far well from my others project. 

# Project Intro: 
This is a photographer website who's profession is photography. He likes to capture moment in a frame. That's the reason why this website's name is Classic Frames. Here, he serve his several services.

## What I did in this web app and what I used here? Let's know step by step about my journey with this web app!

* Installed React and connect it with github.
* Search google for a photographer website's name suggestion.
* Installed React Router

* Made a service fake data and shown it in the service section.
* Designed login and signin section and made them responsive.

End. This is the short list that  i did with this project.Thank you!
 








## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
